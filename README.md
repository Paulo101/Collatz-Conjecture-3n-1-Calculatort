# Collatz-Conjecture-3n-1-Calculatort
handy online tool to calculate and graph the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n.

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. ... 
The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
